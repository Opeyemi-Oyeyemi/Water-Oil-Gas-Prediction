# Water-Oil-Gas-Prediction

## Aim:
Develop a machine learning model to predict oil, gas, and water production based on historical records (past production data and associated parameters).

## Dataset:
The production data provided is a conceptual oil field with historical production information such as Well Code, Field Name, Downhole Pressure, Tubing Head Pressure, Choke Size e.t.c. (Units are in Field Units).

## Evaluation:
The predictive modelâ€™s accuracy and performance would be evaluated with key performance indicators such as RMSE, R2, MAE, MSE, and MAPE.

Total Production Estimation of the total oil, gas and water production (over the history and forecast periods) would be provided as output.
